    "In this class, we will do our coding in Python. This is a coding language that has a lot of advantages. First, it has a relatively easy learning curve. If you've done coding before, you should catch on quickly. If not, it is an intuitive language. Second, it is *open-source*. This means that the entire coding language is freely accessible for anyone. That means you can use it on any machine without any cost. It also means that people can develop code for it and share their code with others. Python makes it extremely easy to *import* the code written by others. Third, because code is being constantly developed and shared, it is quite easy to start writing powerful code since we can take advantage of the wonderful programs written by others!\n",
